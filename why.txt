Since I was 10 years old I have been fascinated by electronics. As a youn aprentice working for a large elctronics firm in the still relevant UK electronics industry of the 1980's I found myself working with in-circuit testers.

I loved the way you could command volmeters and vDC sources to be connected to different bits of the circuit un der computer control. One thing that particularly fascinated me was the frequency source. This was a 50/50 duty cycle square wave generator at TTL levels. It was based around a VCO and required frequent calibration to generate accurate(ish) frequencies. Over time this had settled in my mind and as i moved on to different companies but still in the same arena I had an urge to build my own Frequency Generator. Eartly on this was based around TTL counters and all sorts but my designs were never really tested and were even poor, one I remember used counters and would guarantee a set number of edges in a second, but forget any sort of duty cycle!

So 30 years on, I am in IT but I never get near a soldering iron now. Out of the blue, I needed a hobby and I decided that I would start up with electronics as I got so much joy from it years ago.

My skills are intact although a little out of time... I still think in terms of discreet logic ICs with micro-processors to make sense of it all and my "projects" reflect this - not intending to be the most efficient design or something I could manufacture but something to keep my brain ticking over and reward me with "itches scratched".

This board is a single solution Frequency Meter and Frequency Generator. A PIC micro-controller hooks it all together. 

The measurement side of things is done by a single chip, with some logic and a precision 1 second gate... hold the gate open for a second, count the pulses, get your measurement. The precision gate is derived by dividing the clock for the PIC down - 6 4017s (first int hechain is HC4017 to handle the clock) do this nicely - it really is a great (if large) solution, then using a final 4017 to count 8 ulses of my 8Hz clock gives me a gate of one second +/- 100ppm. 

The generator is built around LTC6903 (all my demons defeated!). It will hit 68MHz but doesn't go down very far and one thing I wanted was a good range of AF. Also, the device is less stable at the extremes of its ranges. I divide it down through a 15 stage binary divider and then choose which of the 16 resultant clocks I feed to the outside world with a selector. I still get my 68MHz but by going to the lowest frequency of the chip and then the lowest "tap" ont he divider, I can get 0.03Hz out of the circuit - Much lower than I need (unless I want to upset next-doors elephant) but it demonstrates the range: 30mHz to 68MHz.

So now we come back to "why?". As my wife asked "what will we be able to do with it?". It will become part of my bench equipment. Yes I know I can buy a frequency meter and generator combined, but can it be computer controlled? (Yes, both the FM & FG talk to a PC using a USB and can be instructed and read in software) and is the frequency precision set with no trimming or measuring necessary?

It's a trinket... a useful one (to me at any rate) but most of all it has been great fun to build.
